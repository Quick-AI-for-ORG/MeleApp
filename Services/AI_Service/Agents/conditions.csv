Rule,Condition,Vent Action,Fan Action,Evaporative Cooler Action,Description
1,"temp < 32 AND (cooler_evap = True OR cooler_fan = True)",Close if outside temp < hive temp,Off,Off,"Turn off cooling when temperature is already low, close vent if outside is colder"
2,"temp < 32 AND outside_temp > hive_temp",Open,Off,Off,"When too cold but outside is warmer, open vent to let in warm air"
3,"temp < 32 AND outside_temp <= hive_temp",Close,Off,Off,"When too cold and outside is colder, close vents to retain heat"
4,"temp > 34 AND outside_temp < hive_temp",Open,On,Off,"When too hot and outside is cooler, open vent and use fan"
5,"temp > 34 AND outside_temp >= hive_temp",Close,On,On,"When too hot and outside is hotter, close vent and use evaporative cooling"
6,"humidity < 50 AND temp >= 32",Current state,On,On,"When humidity is low and temp is normal/high, use evaporative cooling"
7,"humidity < 50 AND temp < 32 AND outside_humidity > hive_humidity",Open,On,Off,"When humidity is low but temp is also low, use fan only and open vent if outside humidity is higher"
8,"humidity > 60 AND temp < 34 AND outside_humidity < hive_humidity",Open,Current state,Off,"When humidity is high but temp isn't too high, open vent if outside is drier"
9,"humidity > 60 AND temp >= 34",Open if outside temp < hive temp,On,Off,"When humidity is high and temp is high, use fan and open vent if outside is cooler"
10,"32 <= temp <= 34 AND 50 <= humidity <= 60",Current state,Current state,Current state,"When conditions are optimal, maintain current state"
11,"temp > 34 AND humidity > 60",Open (if outside_temp < hive_temp),On,Off,"Prioritize cooling without worsening humidity - use vent if outside is cooler"
12,"32 <= temp <= 34 AND humidity < 50",Close,On,On,"Boost humidity safely while maintaining optimal temperature"
13,"temp > 34 AND humidity < 50",Close,On,On,"Simultaneous cooling and humidification - seal hive and activate full cooling"
14,"Sensor discrepancy > 2°C or >10% humidity",Maintain,Maintain,Maintain,"Flag for manual inspection - don't trust conflicting sensor data"
15,"Transition state (e.g., temp ±0.5°C of threshold)",Current state,Current state,Current state,"Monitor rate of change before acting"
16,"External weather shock (e.g., sudden rain)",Close if outside_humidity spikes,On,Off,"Emergency response to unexpected external conditions"
